When looking for a new fun project on the MSX I realized that almost nobody uses the MSX2 screen 0.

So maybe it is time to create a tribute to this underused screen 0 

Welcome to this screen 0 tribute

Most MSX users will know that screen 0 is character based screen mode.
And it is mostly used for texteditors, music composing programs or by most people for entering Basic programs.

But trying to explain a character based screen mode to ordinary people will make them think of fancy hacker movie scene were some protagonist guesses the password just in time. 

Or they start thinking about the Matrix character rain.

Maybe we could create a game like River Raid in screen 0
But that would introduce extra code like userinput and some decent gameplay routine so let's skip game programming for now.

Of course you migh thave noticed by now that everything moves one character at a time.
This is because it is extremly hard to make something like a smoothscroll
And if you would create somethin like a smoothscrool it is porbably only possible for one line 
or maybe not. We could ofcourse scroll the same line of text on all lines
It also isn't verry likely that a programmer can introduce an extra scroll direction.
Or introduce some extra big scroller in front of the little scroller.

It might even be possible to create some metablobs in screen 0.

Or recreate one of those timeless classical effects in old skool demos like the fire routine

Or even rotating text with motion blur.

Or the good old rotazoomer.

This demo will relaunch in 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
